# find_a_person

Hi! I am from Catania, and I like working on open source projects. 
Pls follow me on twitter: @con

In this project I will be developing a QR-code based people connector, where you can scan and find the location of the person and connect with them. 
Project starting soon! For more details contact: connor.Baglioni@outlook.com.
