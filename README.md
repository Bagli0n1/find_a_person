# find_a_person
Hi! I am from Sicily, and I like working on open source projects. Please follow me on twitter: @bagli000n1 

In this project I will be developing a QR-code based people connector, where you can scan and find the location of the person and connect with them. 
Project starting soon! For more details contact: connor.Baglioni@outlook.com
